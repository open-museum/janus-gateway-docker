## Installation

Edit `/src/conf/janus.jcfg` to your liking. Take special care to enable/disable the plugins:

```text
# You can choose which of the available plugins should be
# enabled or not. Use the 'disable' directive to prevent Janus from
# loading one or more plugins: use a comma separated list of plugin file
# names to identify the plugins to disable. By default all available
# plugins are enabled and loaded at startup.
plugins: {
	#disable = "libjanus_voicemail.so,libjanus_recordplay.so"
	disable = "libjanus_nosip.so,libjanus_recordplay.so,libjanus_sip.so,libjanus_streaming.so,libjanus_textroom.so,libjanus_videocall.so,libjanus_videoroom.so,libjanus_voicemail.so"
````

Use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to build the image.

```bash
docker build -t openmuseum/janus-gateway-docker ./src/.
```

## Usage

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
